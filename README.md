# sketchpad

So far, I was able to complete the project's requirements and little things that I personally wanted to add.

Reqs:
*created 16x16 grid using js
*set mouseover effect to color squares
*add element that allows user to change grid

Me:
*color picker to allow user to change colors of squares
*click grid to start coloring
*clear grid button, which clears grid but retains size
*reset button, which clears grid & resets to default size (16x16)

I will eventually add more CSS but for right now, I want to learn more.
